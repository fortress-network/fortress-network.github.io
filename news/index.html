                <strong>Server Release</strong> - We are excited to announce the official release of FortressNetwork!
                The official release of FortressNetwork is coming soon! Currently, the server is still in development on
                our local machines. Due to budget constraints, we have not yet secured a hosting provider. We appreciate
                your patience and support as we work towards making the server available to everyone.
